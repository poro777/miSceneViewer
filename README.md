- `Left mouse`: drag to control view direction
- `Esc`: Quit

# Mitsube Scene Generator (c++)
Convert gltf 2.0 to mitsube scene. 
gltf file can be exported from blender (.gltf + .bin + textures)
1. Object:
    Suppot object hierarchy. Multiple meshes (different materials in one object).
1. Material Support:
    Only supports Principled BSDF.
    Includes 
    - Base color (color3D or texture)
    - Metallic
    - Roughness
    - Transmission, and index of refraction (IOR).

2. Lighting Support:
    Only supports material emission (area light).

3. Camera Support:
    Only export camera pose. The views in blender and mitsuba may not match exactly.

4. Animation Support:
    Animated objects cannot have another animated object as their parent.
    Can animate to camera
