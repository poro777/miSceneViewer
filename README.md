# Mitsube Scene Viewer and Generator(from blender)
# Mitsube Scene Viewer
Simple mitsube viewer in pygame.
- Integraor parameter control (SPP„ÄÅdepth...)
- Progress output (average output images)
- FLIP error map
- Animation
- Save image

![](/images/miViewer.png)

## Requirements
Install PyTorch(cuda) and packages in requiremetns.txt

### Optional
- [FLIP](https://github.com/NVlabs/flip): Show error map.

- [pycuda](https://github.com/inducer/pycuda): Render the image without copying torch.tensor to host memory. Install pycuda with gl extension.
1. Clone  `git clone --recursive https://github.com/inducer/pycuda.git `
2. Create siteconf.py file `python ./configure.py --cuda-enable-gl`
3. Build `python setup.py build`
4. Install `python setup.py install`

## Run
Run the default scene `python ./main.py`

## Viewer Control
- `WASD`: fps control
- `QE`: Move up, down
- `R`: Reset position
- `Left mouse`: drag to control view direction
- `Esc`: Quit

# Mitsube Scene Generator (c++)
Convert gltf 2.0 to mitsube scene. 
gltf file can be exported from blender (.gltf + .bin + textures)
1. Object:
    Suppot object hierarchy. Multiple meshes (different materials in one object).
1. Material Support:
    Only supports Principled BSDF.
    Includes 
    - Base color (color3D or texture)
    - Metallic
    - Roughness
    - Transmission, and index of refraction (IOR).

2. Lighting Support:
    Only supports material emission (area light).

3. Camera Support:
    Only export camera pose. The views in blender and mitsuba may not match exactly.

4. Animation Support:
    Animated objects cannot have another animated object as their parent.
    Can animate to camera

## Examples
Some sample scenes can be found [here](./scene/)
## Run
- Install dependency `assimp`, `fmt` and `tinyxml2` which can be installed via `vcpkg`.
- Complie the file `miSceneExporter/gltf2miScene.cpp` using c++17.
- Run `gltf2miScene.exe path_to_gltf_file.gltf`.
- The results are located in `miScene/` under the current folder.
